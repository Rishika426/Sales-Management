# Sales-Management
This project is about the sales management of a general store. It receives information of items from the administrator and customer details from the customer. It shows the menu and automatically deducts the number of products in cart from the total count. Along with this, it generates a bill automatically and adds 18% GST and deducts the discounted amount. It also contains feedback form and customer care services.
